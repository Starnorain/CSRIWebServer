# CSRIWebServer
## 1、Overview
  Recently, I have been inspired by the source code of zeromq and muduo, but I feel that the code architecture is more complicated. It is still a bit difficult for me to understand deeply when I just came out of campus, so I want to deepen my understanding by trying to write the web server code. Understanding of knowledge, I want to use this knowledge to make something cooler than just a simple server in the textbook. And in the process of implementation, you can often learn things outside of textbooks. Thinking that project-oriented is the best way to learn programming. And there is nothing more fun than creating something by yourself. "Pointing an actual browser to your server and watching him display a complex web page with text and images is really exciting."
